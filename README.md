# Valuation of shares of the selected company
## Valuation of a selected listed company using 3 methods:

### 1. Method based on discounted cash flow (DCF)
Discounted cash flow (DCF) is one of the methods used to value an investment, company or other asset based on its expected future cash flows and changes in the value of money over time. The purpose of this method is to estimate and discount all future cash flows to determine their present value. The discount rate level is the cost of capital and takes into account the risk assessment regarding future cash flows. The discounted cash flow method is widely used in the areas of financial investment analysis, real estate development and corporate management. <br>
The calculations given in the project are based on this method and adapted to the market environment based on personal experience.

### 2. The method is based on the increase in book value (according to Warren Buffett)
The method used to determine the intrinsic value of the company based on the book value. First, the average increase in book value for the selected period is determined. Then the book value is calculated for a given period in the future. Additionally, the value of the dividend paid (if it is) is added to the book value. The final intrinsic value is the book value for x years discounted with the cost of capital, which in this case is the yield on 10-year government bonds. In addition, an assumed value is added to the discount (it is a margin of valuation error). <br>
Book value per share = Equity / Number of shares, and  indicates the value of the company's assets and informs shareholders of the book value per share.

### 3. ROE-based method
The method used to calculate the intrinsic value of a company based on profit and ROE. The intrinsic value of the company is determined as the product of the earnings per share and the return on equity and then compared with the current share price. <br>
The return on equity is an indicator of how much profit the company managed to generate from its equity. ROE is the profit for a given period to equity at the beginning of a given period
